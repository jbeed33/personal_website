              As a co-lead, I provided guidance to a team of five other
              developers throughout the 10 week project lifecycle. This included
              assisting with introducing developers to the MERN stack,
              collecting and analyzing requirements, facilitating collaboration
              during planning and design phases, and overseeing as well as
              documenting the architecture of the entire application. My primary
              focus was leading and collaborating with the backend team to
              implement crucial features such as Authentication, achieved
              through Passport.js and OAuth, ensuring user data encryption for
              privacy, and constructing REST APIs.

              An application that found the most cost effective way to move
              containers inside a shipping port. It was built using c# for
              frontend and c++ for backend. My group and I communicated with a
              stakeholder, our professor, to gather comprehensive project
              requirements and constraints for the system My group and I
              strategically planned, developed, and tested the application with
              the objective of optimizing cost effective methods for loading and
              unloading containers onto a ship.

              A C++-based command-line text based adventure game was crafted,
              offering multiple endings, a dynamic plot, and engaging
              characters. I collaborated on a school group project practicing
              Agile development methodologies. We successfully applied software
              design patterns for enhancing the project structure and its
              scalability. I contributed to the implementation and design of the
              weapons system and menu functionality. This led to a more
              user-friendly experience and allowed my team to reuse components.
